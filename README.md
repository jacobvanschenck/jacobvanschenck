## 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Jacob
## 👨🏼‍💻 A little about me
Hi 👋🏻 My name is Jacob and I have been building dApps and websites for the past 3 years. After 10+ years working for an international missions organization, I decided it was time to come back to my first love of coding. It's my mission to create innovative applications that revolutionize the way people interact with technology.

🧰 Built multiple scaling products from Design -> Deliver

🤝 Mentored dozens of young people in personal development with clear goals, encouragement and accountability

🌍 10+ years of working with different cultures

✈️ Fun Fact: I have led 5 international trips of students to over 13 countries

## 🔧 Technologies and Languages
