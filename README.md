# 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Jacob
## 👨🏼‍💻 A little about me
Hi 👋🏻 My name is Jacob and I have been building dApps and websites for the past 3 years. 

My short story: 10+ years in Christian non profit leadership and international outreach coordinator. I then decided it was time to come back to my first love of coding. 

📈 It's my mission to create innovative applications that revolutionize the way people interact with technology.

📱 Developed a Capacitor-based mobile application by collaborating with product design teams, increasing our userbase by over 20,000 users

🌐 Led the development of a web portal an affiliate program using NextJS, resulting in nearly 1,000 new signups

🤝 Mentored dozens of young people in personal development with clear goals, encouragement and accountability

🌍 10+ years of working with different cultures

✈️ Fun Fact: I have led 5 international trips of students to over 13 countries
