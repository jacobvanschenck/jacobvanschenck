# 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Jacob
## 👨🏼‍💻 A little about me
Hi 👋🏻 My name is Jacob and I have been building web and mobile products for the past 3 years.

My short story: 10+ years in Christian non profit leadership and international outreach coordinator. I then decided it was time to come back to my first love of coding.

After spending 6 months of teaching myself to write web apps, I joined a local startup in town and began building products to crack the egg of the consumer crypto space.

I am a passionate, self-driven engineer with keen product sense, collaborating with design teams to build innovative user experiences.

✈️ Fun Fact: I have led 5 international trips of students to over 13 countries
